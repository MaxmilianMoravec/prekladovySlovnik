My school project is app made by Python an PyInstaller

This python application, programmed with the help of the tkinter library, is designed to search for the specified text for translation from local 2 files. The first file (nezname.txt) contains the words to be translated and the second file (translation.txt) contains the translation. Translation pairs are on the same line in both files.
